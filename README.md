### Greetings!~
I'm `PythonTryHard`, a pursuer of a Master of Science and Engineering degree in Food Technology. 

### But that doesn't relate to programming at all!
Yea. I just like to write code, that's all. I fell in love with Chemistry before falling for Programming. Am I two-timing? Maybe. No. Maybe.

To be honest: Colorful liquids makes me go "✨ Uwah~ ✨".

### Did you just "Uwah~"?
I'm what the internet would classify as "a weeb". Can't help it.

### Sure... How can I contact you?
Coming soon.
